Here is a collection of Power BI projects and dashboards that illustrate my talents and knowledge in data visualisation, business intelligence, and analytics using Power BI.

# About Me
I am a dedicated data geek with extensive experience in Power BI. I have vast expertise converting raw data into relevant insights, developing interactive dashboards, and advising organisations on data-driven decisions. This portfolio demonstrates my abilities to use Power BI to graphically present difficult data. 

## Project 1 : Bank Customer Churn Analysis
- Analyse the data to obtain a few insights about client churn.
- It is important for banks to understand what causes a client to quit the organisation.
  
Churn prevention enables businesses to create loyalty programs and retention efforts in order to maintain as many customers as feasible.

## Project 2 : Super Market Sales Insights
The dataset used in this dashboard contains detailed transactional data for a fictional superstore, providing insights across various dimensions such as sales, profits, customer segments, product categories, shipping modes, and geographic regions. Key fields include:

- Order Information: Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode, and Customer ID.
- Customer Details: Customer Name, Segment, City, State, Country, Postal Code, and Region.
- Product Data: Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name, Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit.

Why This Data is Important for a Store
- Sales & Profit Analysis: Understanding which products, categories, and customer segments drive the most revenue and profit helps the store focus on high-performing areas while optimizing underperforming segments.
- Customer Segmentation: Insights into customer behavior across different segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) allow for personalized marketing strategies and improving customer retention.
- Product & Inventory Optimization: Analyzing product performance helps in making data-driven decisions on inventory management, ensuring that top-selling products are well-stocked while reducing surplus of low-demand items.
- Geographical Insights: Identifying top-performing regions and cities provides opportunities to focus marketing efforts and optimize shipping logistics in those areas.
- Shipping Efficiency: By analyzing ship modes and shipping times, the store can streamline its order fulfillment processes, reduce delays, and improve customer satisfaction.
- Discount & Profitability Correlation: Evaluating the impact of discounts on sales and profits allows the store to strike a balance between offering discounts and maintaining profitability.
